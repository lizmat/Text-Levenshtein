=begin pod

This is a direct port of the Perl 5 version and should be close to 100% similar
other then some Perl 6 idioms. I didn't port the fastdistance routine since the
logic was buggy and the code to fix it made it the same speed as the regular
distance routine.


=head1 NAME

Text::Levenshtein - An implementation of the Levenshtein edit distance

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Text::Levenshtein qw(distance);

    print distance("foo","four");
    # prints "2"

    my @words=("four","foo","bar");
    my @distances=distance("foo",@words);

    print "@distances";
    # prints "2 0 3"
 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements the Levenshtein edit distance. The Levenshtein edit
distance is a measure of the degree of proximity between two strings. This
distance is the number of substitutions, deletions or insertions ("edits")
needed to transform one string into the other one (and vice versa). When two
strings have distance 0, they are the same. A good point to start is:
